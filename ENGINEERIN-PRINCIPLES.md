# AI Engineering Principles

EMPE is built on a set of engineering principles for AI-native workflows.

## Architecture First

Code is a consequence of structure.

## Deterministic Context

AI performs best when given layered artifacts instead of long prompts.

## Role-Based AI Interaction

Agents simulate engineering roles:
- Architect
- Backend Engineer
- Frontend Engineer
- QA

## Human in the Loop

Validation remains a human responsibility.
