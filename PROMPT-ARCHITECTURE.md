# Prompt Architecture

EMPE prompts are not isolated commands.

They are layers of context.

Structure Prompts → Define system boundaries.
Mapping Prompts → Generate flowcharts and schemas.
Planning Prompts → Create execution workspaces.
Execution Prompts → Drive AI implementation.

Each prompt assumes artifacts from previous phases.
