# The EMPE Manifesto

AI is not a replacement for engineering thinking.

It is an execution amplifier.

EMPE exists to shift developers from:

Prompt Writers → System Architects.

The goal is not faster coding.

The goal is controlled acceleration.

Principles:

- Architecture before implementation.
- Context before prompts.
- Structure before execution.
- Humans remain the directors of AI systems.
